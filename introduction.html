            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I was born and raised in Charlotte, NC, and my whole life I’ve been in the arts or communications, whether on stage in a musical or on stage emceeing the largest fundraiser in a state. I love anything creative, video games, movies, Dungeons & Dragons, but my brother is a STEM kid, so of course I’m going to try computer science too (I dropped out of AP Comp Sci Principles halfway through the year). And then I come to college, accidentally join said college’s robotics team, become an officer on said robotics team, and here I am attempting a minor in Human-Centered Design. All’s well that ends well, I hope.</li>
            <li><strong>Academic background:</strong> I am a second-semester sophomore at Charlotte with a major in Communications (a specialization in Media & Technology) as well as a minor/certificate in Video Production and a minor in Human-Centered Design (80% comp sci 20% psychology) so I am rather well-rounded in my interests, but my true abilities (or lack of) are to be discovered.</li>
            <li><strong>Background in this subject:</strong> I attempted AP Comp Sci Principles sophomore year of high school but was struggling to grasp the material and it was causing me anxiety to the point my parents encouraged me to drop out. I know the bare basics, and I am learning stuff via exposure from the robotics team, but I am excited to see what I can do.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Laptop with Windows 11.</li>
            <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking:</strong> 
                <ol>
                    <li>COMM 3100 - Communications Research Methods: Required course (and I need to improve my “googling” skill).</li>
                    <li>COMM 3120 - Media, Technology, and Communication: Required course (but I want to know why the internet is the way it is when it comes to chronically online people and parasocial relationships).</li>
                    <li>FILM 3220 - Intro to Screenwriting: Required course for my Video Production Minor (and I want to see if I can write something as good as Arcane).</li>
                    <li>COMM 3101 - Persuasion: Required course (I want to learn how to get what I want).</li>
                    <li>ITSC 1110 - Intro to Comp Sci Principles: Required course for my Human-Centered Design Minor (but also just to see if I can pass my second try at a comp sci class).</li>
                 </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Funny/Interesting item about yourself:</strong> I was an actor in a commercial that aired during a NASCAR race!
            <li><strong>I'd also like to share:</strong> My disability is a genetic disorder! My DNA mutated to make my body unable to produce the Collagen VI protein, which messes up the structure of my muscles, which makes me weaker than a normal human and more inflexible, the science behind it is cool, but the disability itself not so much.</li>
